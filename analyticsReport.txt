From the ten most popular data visualisation libraries of Python we short listed Seaborn and Pygal.We finlaised the 
one which has most efficient online support.
We used two different visualization represntation: Scatter plot and Barplot. 

- Scatter Plot using PyGal Library 
Humidity with respect to temperature (humidity y-axis & temperature x-axis). 
We used 4 different time block colour code Red(12-13:59),Violet(14-15:59),Cyan(16-17:59),Orange(18-19:59)
This will visually reflect our data time span  


- Barplot using Seaborn
For Barplot visualization we used Seaborn wrapper library built on matplotlib.
Matplotlib was the first Python data visualization library .It is highly influenced by matlab hence the title MatPlotlib .
MatPlotlib was complex and with long syntex which is why industry came up with wrappers libraries like pandas and Seaborn.
Graph plots min/max values of temperature and humidty with respect to date
